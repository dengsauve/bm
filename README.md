# bm
CLI Bookmark Tool, built with ❤️ in Ruby


## Goals

### CRUD

- [ ] `bm add ${url}` add a website to your library
- [ ] `bm ${search_term}` open the first matching url
- [ ] `bm search ${search_term}` spits out a list of matching urls with their ids
- [ ] `bm edit ${url_id}` using search, you can get the id of the bookmark you want to edit
- [ ] `bm [rm|remove|delete] ${url_id}` using search, you can get the id of the bookmark you want to remove
- [ ] `bm` launch an interactive terminal (maybe, depends on if it's useful)

### Persistence

Local DB or .json file seems like the best bet

### Syncing

Going the JSON route would make it easy to update a .git repo. Not sure what to do about a DB
